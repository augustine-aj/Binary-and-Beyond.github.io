                            <p class="lead mt-3">Performance anxiety in the run-up to interview questions is totally normal. After all, interviews can be intimidating. Even the world’s most senior and experienced professionals (including interviewers themselves) would agree.</p><p class="lead mt-3">Without a crystal ball, it’s impossible to know exactly what interview questions you’ll face—but that doesn’t mean you can’t prepare yourself! To help ease those pre-interview jitters, we’ve compiled 35 common job interview questions (plus advice on how to answer them).</p>

                            <h2>35 common interview questions (and answers)</h2>
                            <h3 id="tell-me-about-yourself">1. &#8220;Tell me about yourself&#8221;</h3>
                            <p>This question is often used as an icebreaker, but answering it concisely can be a challenge. To avoid monologuing your life story, focus on your relevant technical skills and accomplishments. </p>
                            <p>Start by summarizing your background and how it led to your current job or interest in the role, before highlighting any significant projects you&#8217;ve worked on or notable career highlights.<b></b></p>
                            <h3 id="what-is-your-greatest-weakness">2. &#8220;What is your greatest weakness?&#8221;</h3>
                            <p>Ah, the dreaded &#8220;weakness&#8221; interview question. Bet you didn’t think this one would be so high up on the list! </p>
                            <p>This question is an opportunity to showcase your self-awareness and willingness to improve. </p>
                            <p>Try to avoid using clichéd language like &#8220;perfectionism&#8221; or &#8220;working too hard&#8221; (easier said than done, we know!) Instead, think of a genuine weakness you’ve worked to overcome. Maybe you learned to take a step back when you’re overwhelmed, or you’ve taken on a mentor to help you become a better manager. Be specific about your progress, and provide examples if you can.</p>
                            <h3 id="why-do-you-want-to-work-for-this-company">3. &#8220;Why do you want to work for this company?&#8221;</h3>
                            <p>With this question, your interviewers are testing your knowledge of the company—and your alignment with their mission and values. In addition to researching the company&#8217;s products, services, and industry focus, get up to speed with any recent company changes or achievements. </p>
                            <p>Highlight specific projects or initiatives that interest you, and demonstrate your desire to work with like-minded professionals. Above all, be ready to discuss how you can contribute to the company’s success. <b></b></p>

                            <p>Maybe you thrive in collaborative environments, where ideas are freely shared and feedback is encouraged. Or perhaps you prefer to work independently, taking ownership of your projects and seeing them through to completion. </p>
                            <p>Whatever your preference, your response should reflect your personal style—as well as how that style aligns with the company culture and the expectations of the position.

                            <p>To answer this question, talk about some of the strategies you&#8217;ve used in the past to stay calm under pressure (i.e., taking a deep breath, breaking down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable steps, seeking support from a manager or mentor, etc.). </p>
                            <p>You can also highlight your ability to prioritize tasks, stay organized, and think clearly when things get hectic. <b></b></p>

Be honest but tactful: Employers appreciate transparency, but badmouthing your current employer or colleagues will only reflect poorly on you. </p>
                            <p>Instead, focus on what prompted your desire to seek out new opportunities; whether it&#8217;s professional growth, a change in industry, or just seeking new challenges.

                            <p>The interview question can be nerve-wracking, but it&#8217;s essential to tackle it head-on with honesty. First, acknowledge the gap and clarify why it occurred: whether it&#8217;s due to personal reasons, further education, or travel. Next, highlight any skills or experiences you gained during that period. Did you network? Volunteer? Learn a new language? Talk about how these experiences prepared you for your current position.</p>
                            <p>Don’t fall into the trap of making excuses or apologizing for the gap. A gap in your resume doesn&#8217;t define you; and addressing it confidently can set you apart from other candidates.<b></b></p>

                            <p>Perhaps they view you as a reliable teammate who always completes tasks on time, or an excellent communicator who can easily navigate conflicts. Whichever traits you mention, be sure to provide specific examples that support your answer. </p>
                            <p>Remember, honesty is always the best policy—exaggerating or misrepresenting yourself to impress the interviewer won’t win you any brownie points.

                                <span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, when interviewers ask this question, they’re thinking about your onboarding schedule. Ultimately, they want to know how long it will be before you can get stuck in and start adding value to the company. </span>
